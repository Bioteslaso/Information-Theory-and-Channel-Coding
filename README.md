# Information-Theory-and-Channel-Coding
Code developed while studying the course on Information Theory and Channel Coding to better understand it.

Different files on different topics, including Signal Modulation, Information Theory, Channel Coding, etc.
Most files were written by me but some or some parts may not be my own. 
Hopefully, they will be helpful to anyone starting this topic.
